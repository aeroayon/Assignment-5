What is the difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll?
Ans:In JavaScript, getElementById() is utilized to pick a single element according to its unique id, returning either one element or null if thereâ€™s no match. getElementsByClassName() retrieves all elements with a certain class name and delivers them as a live HTMLCollection, which means the list automatically updates when the DOM changes. Conversely, querySelector() permits the use of any valid CSS selector but only retrieves the first matching element, whereas querySelectorAll() also employs CSS selectors but provides all matching elements in a static NodeList that does not refresh with DOM changes. In summary, getElementById targets a single element by its id, getElementsByClassName selects multiple elements by class, and the querySelector methods offer greater flexibility as they accommodate any CSS selector but vary in whether they return a single match or all matches


How do you create and insert a new element into the DOM?
Ans:In JavaScript, you create and add a new element to the DOM by initially employing document.createElement() to create the element, then defining its content or properties like text, id, or class, and ultimately inserting it into the document using methods such as appendChild(), append(), prepend(), or insertBefore(). For instance, if you generate a new paragraph utilizing document.createElement("p") and insert text into it using textContent, you can subsequently attach it to a current container element by invoking appendChild() on that container. This procedure guarantees that the new component is accurately incorporated and shown within the layout of the webpage


What is Event Bubbling and how does it work?
Ans:Event bubbling refers to the method by which events travel through the DOM. When an event takes place on a nested element, like a button within a div, the event initially activates on the innermost element where it happened and then "bubbles up" through its parent elements, reaching the document or window, triggering any event listeners in the process. If you click a button within a div, the click event on the button triggers first, followed by the same event on the parent div, then on its parent, and so forth, unless event.stopPropagation() is called to halt the bubbling. This system enables parent elements to react to events initiated by their children without the need to attach listeners to each child separately

What is Event Delegation in JavaScript? Why is it useful?
Ans:Event delegation in JavaScript is a method where you attach one event listener to a shared parent element rather than adding separate listeners to each child element, allowing events to propagate up from the child elements. Within the listener, you examine the event target (event.target) to identify which child element activated the event and react appropriately.
This method is advantageous as it lowers memory consumption by minimizing listeners, streamlines code upkeep, and enables management of elements added dynamically that might not be present when the page first loads. For instance, rather than assigning a click listener to each button in a list, you can attach a single listener to the list itself, managing clicks on any button, including new buttons that may be added subsequently

What is the difference between preventDefault() and stopPropagation() methods?
Ans:In JavaScript, preventDefault() and stopPropagation() are two separate methods utilized in event handling, each with unique functions.
preventDefault() stops the default action of an event by the browser. For instance, it can prevent a form submission when the submit button is clicked or stop a link from taking the user to a different page. It does not prevent the event from propagating up the DOM.
stopPropagation(), conversely, prevents the event from continuing to bubble (or capture) higher or lower within the DOM tree. This indicates that parent or ancestor elements won't capture the event, but the browser's default action for the event might still take place unless you also invoke preventDefault().
preventDefault() manages the browser's actions, whereas stopPropagation() manages the event's movement within the DOM
